# About me.

I'm a theatre director and dramaturg based in Phoenix, AZ. I'm currently a
senior at Arizona State University, majoring in Theatre and in Physics. My
passions lie in contemporary works and new play development (and, in fact, all
of the plays I've directed outside of an educational setting have been
in-development plays). My interests and specialties are in horror, atmospheric
work, and immersive theatre.

As a director, I've done a lot of work with
[Binary Theatre Company](https://www.binarytheatre.org), a student and new
work-centered theatre company associated with ASU, directing the one-act
immersive horror play [An Unsettled Supper](/projects/an-unsettled/supper) and
the three-part audio drama 
[There's Something Out There](/projects/theres-something). I've also worked in
an educational setting, directing 10-minute and one-act plays under professor
William Partlan.

As a dramaturg, I've recently worked with ASU's theatre department on a recent
production of The Snow, directed by Claire Redfield and Jillian Johnson. I was
able to put my physics knowledge and research experience to use to help
contexxtualize the scientific process and the philosophies related to it for
the actors in a show centered around a young inventor.
