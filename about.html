		<p>
			<b>Daniel Moore</b> is a theatre director and dramaturg
			based in the Phoenix, AZ area. Currently a senior
			student at Arizona State University, majoring in
			Theatre and Physics, Daniel has a passion for
			contemporary work and new play development.
			Daniel's interests and specialties lie in horror,
			atmospheric works and works in which the audience gets
			to have an intimate relationship with the performance.
		</p>
		<p>
			<br />
			As a director, Daniel has often worked with 
			<a href="https://www.binarytheatre.org/">
				Binary Theatre Company</a>,
			a student and new work-centered
			theatre company associated with ASU, directing the
			one-act immersive horror play
			<i><a href="directing/supper">
					An Unsettled Supper
			</a></i>
			written by collaborator Nicholas Tran. He has
			also directed for their annual Playfest, a festival of
			student-written 10-minute plays, this year directing
			<i>Mirror Image</i> by Tori Espinosa. He has also
			worked in an educational setting, directing 10-minute
			and one-act plays for college acting students in the
			classroom, under supervision and tutelage of director
			William Partlan.
		</p>
		<p>
			<br />
			In his non-realistic directing work, Daniel is interested
			in exploring the relationship between the performance,
			the performers, and the audience, and in creating
			distinctive atmospheres and experiences to facilitate an
			understanding of unique individual experiences,
			especially those related to often-underrepresented
			mental health struggles. In his realistic work, he
			seeks to showcase the lived reality of real people, and
			especially their internal struggles and the
			insufficiency of language to communicate those
			struggles to those around them.
