<h1 id="about-me">About me.</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m a theatre director and dramaturg based in Phoenix, AZ. I&rsquo;m currently a
senior at Arizona State University, majoring in Theatre and in Physics. My
passions lie in contemporary works and new play development (and, in fact, all
of the plays I&rsquo;ve directed outside of an educational setting have been
in-development plays). My interests and specialties are in horror, atmospheric
work, and immersive theatre.</p>
<p>As a director, I&rsquo;ve done a lot of work with
<a href="https://www.binarytheatre.org">Binary Theatre Company</a>, a student and new
work-centered theatre company associated with ASU, directing the one-act
immersive horror play <a href="/projects/an-unsettled/supper">An Unsettled Supper</a> and
the three-part audio drama
<a href="/projects/theres-something">There&rsquo;s Something Out There</a>. I&rsquo;ve also worked in
an educational setting, directing 10-minute and one-act plays under professor
William Partlan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently become Artistic Director, as well as a founding member, of
<a href="https://scawwyhowwowtheatre.com">Scawwy Howwow Theatre Company</a>, which we will
be using as a proving grounds to experiment with new methods, genres, and
mediums. My first directing piece through the company is
<a href="https://anchor.fm/scawwowhowwowtheatre">untitled [redacted]</a>.</p>
<p>As a dramaturg, I&rsquo;ve recently worked with ASU&rsquo;s theatre department on a recent
production of The Snow, directed by Claire Redfield and Jillian Johnson. I was
able to put my physics knowledge and research experience to use to help
contexxtualize the scientific process and the philosophies related to it for
the actors in a show centered around a young inventor.</p>
