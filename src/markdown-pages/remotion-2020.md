# About

rEMTION play festival was a socially-distanced open-admission play festival
performed over Zoom and streamed live over Twitch. I directed three shows, one
written for the stage and adapted to the medium, and two written specifically
for the live-stream medium.

rEMOTION premiered June 2020.
