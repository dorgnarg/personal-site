# About

An Unsettled Supper is an experiment with collaborator Nicholas Tran,
exploring how we could use the live-ness and intimacy offered by
theatre in a black box space to amplify the experience of live
horror. The show allowed only twelve audience members in each
showing, and contained no dialogue, so we could really focus on
creating an atmosphere of tension and fear using visual language,
smell, and taste.

An Unsettled Supper debuted as part of Binary Theatre Company's Fall 2019
season, perforing nine shows total over the course of one weekend. We hope to
bring versions of this show to other places in the future, and work on more
pieces exploring how we can build horror in theatre.
